*Data Analyst | Data Engineer | Data scientist *

Welcome to my GitHub.

I am a data professional with a background in engineering systems, data analysis, analytics and Modelling. My journey into data was driven by a simple question:

> How do we turn raw numbers into decisions that create measurable value?

Today, I build analytical systems that transform operational, financial, and business data into structured insights.

## 🧠 Analytical Focus

I am particularly interested in:

* 📊 **Business Intelligence & Reporting** — executive dashboards, KPI tracking, performance analytics
* 💰 **Financial & Investment Analytics** — market analysis, valuation metrics, trend forecasting
* ⚙️ **Operations & Process Analytics** — workflow optimization, performance bottlenecks
* 📈 **Data-Driven Decision Systems** — automation and predictive modeling
* 🌍 **Public & Economic Data Analysis** — macro trends and policy-driven data

I enjoy solving problems where structured thinking, clean modeling, and clarity of insight matter more than complexity.
